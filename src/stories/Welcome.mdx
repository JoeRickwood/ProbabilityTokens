# @garbo-succus/tokens

Welcome to the **@garbo-succus/tokens** asset library! This is a collection of free 3D game tokens and assets designed for use with the [Probability board game simulator](https://probability.nz/).

## What is this?

These assets make building board games easier. Instead of modeling every piece from scratch, use these pre-made tokens in your Probability mods.

## How to use these assets

To use any asset in your Probability board game, reference it directly in your pieces:

```json
{
  "probability": "2024-01-01", 
  "states": [{
    "name": "Game setup",
    "children": [{
      "template": "die",
      "position": [0, 0, 0]
    }]
  }]
}
```

## License: CC-BY 4.0

All assets in this library are released under the **Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC-BY 4.0)**.

### What this means for you:

- âœ… **You can use these assets freely** in any project, including commercial ones
- âœ… **You can modify, remix, and build upon** these assets
- âœ… **You can sell mods** that include these assets
- âœ… **No royalties or fees** are required

### The only requirement:

You must **give appropriate credit**. For Probability mods, you can do this by:

1. **Including attribution in your mod description** on mod.io
2. **Adding a credits section** to your game's documentation
3. **Mentioning the source** in your README or package.json

Example attribution:
> "3D assets from @garbo-succus/tokens (CC-BY 4.0) - https://github.com/garbo-succus/tokens"

### For paid mods:

Yes, you can absolutely use these assets in paid mods! The CC-BY license explicitly allows commercial use. Just make sure to include the attribution as described above.

## Getting started

Browse the **Assets** section in the sidebar to explore available tokens. Each asset page shows:
- Interactive 3D preview
- Template usage instructions  
- Built-in template configuration
- Technical specifications

## Adding new assets

To add a new asset to this documentation:

1. **Create your asset directory** in `src/assets/newAsset/`
2. **Add your GLTF/GLB files** and textures
3. **Create an index.ts** file following the die example:
   ```ts
   import type { PieceTemplate } from "../../types";
   
   const assets = import.meta.glob("./*", { query: "?url", import: "default", eager: true });
   const src = assets["./newAsset.gltf"];
   
   export const newAsset = {
     name: "New Asset Name",
     src,
     scale: [0.016, 0.016, 0.016],
     // ... other properties
   } as PieceTemplate;
   ```
4. **Create a story file** at `src/stories/NewAsset.stories.ts`:
   ```ts
   import type { StoryObj } from '@storybook/html';
   import { newAsset } from '../assets/newAsset';
   import { createAssetMeta, createAssetStory } from './createAssetStory';
   
   const meta = createAssetMeta(newAsset, 'newAsset', 'New Asset');
   
   export default meta;
   
   export const Default: StoryObj = createAssetStory(newAsset, 'newAsset');
   ```

The documentation will automatically include your new asset with interactive 3D preview!

Happy game building! ðŸŽ²
